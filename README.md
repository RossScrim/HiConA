## 🛠️ Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RossScrim/Opera_Phenix_Data_Handler.git
cd Opera_Phenix_Data_Handler
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the package

Install in **editable mode** so you can make changes without reinstalling:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` and registers the CLI command `Opera_Processor`.

---

## 🚀 Usage

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
Opera_Processor
```

This executes the `main()` function from:

```
OperaPhenixDataHandler/main.py
```

---

✅ This ensures relative imports work properly.

> ❌ Do **not** run it like `python main.py` — this may break imports.

---

## 🔄 Uninstall / Cleanup

To uninstall the package:

```bash
pip uninstall Opera_Processor
```

To remove the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf .venv        # macOS/Linux
